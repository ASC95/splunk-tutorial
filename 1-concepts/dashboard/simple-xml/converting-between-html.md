- The resource that I want to read to understand if converting from HTML back into Simple XML is not accessible right now

# Reasons why I should not convert a Simple XML dashboard to HTML
- The nice built-in Splunk dashboard editor cannot edit HTML dashboards
- Dark theme dashboards will be converted into the standard light theme (gasp!)
- I thought there were more reasons, but I can't find them right now
