- Why doesn't "Settings > Distributed search > Search peers" show anything?
- The CLI commands didn't exist for version 7.3.2!
- The REST API isn't working
- I tried searching _metrics, but was told I needed to use the "mstats" command. What does that do?

- "Settings > Distributed search > Search peers" _does_ show the actual search peers if they are properly configured!
  - This page also shows the replication status of the knowledge bundle!
