- The documentation states that I can choose "one of six available map tiles," but it doesn't say what they are
  - One is open street maps, one is bing, but wait... I should be able to pick _any_ map tile provider that I want. In that case, what does the
    documentation even mean?
      - Honestly I have no idea. None of the reserved fields have anything to do with map tiles, and I didn't see anything about map tile resources in
        the source files. Whatever
