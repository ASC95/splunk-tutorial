# Introduction
- Splunk has users. Each user can be assigned one or more roles
- Splunk roles are used for two purposes:
  - All users who have a role form a group. Permissions, such as read/write access to objects, are granted to these groups, not to individual users
    - Double check this. Can individual users get specific permissions?
  - Splunk roles have inherent capabilities which are granted to all users who have the role
    - E.g. the capability to delete data is granted to the "can_delete" role
- Role configuration is stored in `authorize.conf`
  - By default, the the file `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/authorize.conf` creates 5 roles:
    - admin
    - can_delete
    - power
    - splunk-system-role
    - user
