- https://answers.splunk.com/answers/269471/difference-between-renaming-a-field-within-stats-v.html - side effects of rename
# Usage
- x
# Input
- The `rename` command doesn't accept events as input. It just renames a field
# Required arguments
- At least one expression
# Output
- Return a new field that replaces the old, renamed field 
- See the source for using the `rename` command can have unexpected side effects
  - TLDR: renaming a normal field (i.e. a non-derived field) will cause that normal field to no longer exist in later stages of the pipe
# Syntax
- `rename` can be used anywhere to rename a column that appears in the search output
## AS
- `AS` is used to rename a column generated by the `stats` command, or some other commands like `chart`
    - `AS` can also be used inside of the `rename` command!
- Quotations must be used for aliases that contain spaces
- Therefore, I should think of `AS` by itself as a syntactic shortcut, and `AS` in conjunction with `rename` as the full syntax
# Examples
```
sourcetype=access_* status=200 | chart count AS views count(eval(action="addtocart")) AS addtocart count(eval(action="purchase")) AS purchases by
productName | rename productName AS "Product Name", views AS "Views", addtocart AS "Adds to Cart", purchases AS "Purchases"
```
