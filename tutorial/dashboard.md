# Introduction
- A dashboard is made of panels, which are usually connected to reports
- After a search visualization is created, or a report has been saved, it can be added to a new or existing dashboard
- The dashboard editor is useful for adding saved reports to a dashboard
- Directly editing the dashboard XML allows me to customize features that I cannot customize from within the dashboard editor
# Create a dashboard
- Input controls that are added to a dashboard are independent from any panels on the dashboard
    - An input control and a panel must be connected
        - Remember to click "Save" to finish connecting a dashboard input and a panel
